# Project-2
After my first couple attempts at a project did not meet my expectations. I re-evaluted.

I decided to create a site that has helpful tips for WDI students. It will hopefully have helpfully hints and Advice from other students.Alumni and current students can register and log in and leave a helpful hint for their classmates.


Goals
Advice can be added by alumni only.
Advice can be liked/disliked by students.
Logout.
For it to constantly update and grow to include alumni profiles. What they are doing now, ways to contact them(if the alumni allows that)
